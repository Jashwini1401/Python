        "###1.  Explain the purpose and advantages of NumPy in scientific computing and data analysis. How does it enhance Python's capabilities for numerical operations?\n",
        "ANS:- NumPy stands for “Numerical Python” and it is the standard Python library used for working with arrays (i.e.,vectors & matrices), linear algebra, and other numerical computations. NumPy is written in C, making NumPy arrays faster and more memory efficient than Python lists or arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation,\n",
        "sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the core of the NumPy package, is the ndarray object. This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types, with many operations being performed in compiled code for performance. There are several important differences between NumPy arrays and the standard Python sequences:-\n",
        "\n",
        "(i)NumPy arrays have a fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists (which can grow dynamically). Changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array and delete the original.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii)The elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same data type, and thus will be the same size in memory. The exception: one can have arrays of (Python, including NumPy) objects, thereby allowing for arrays of different sized elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "(iii)NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data.Typically, such operations are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using Python’s built-in sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "(iv)A growing plethora of scientific and mathematical Python-based packages are using NumPy arrays; though these typically support Python-sequence input, they convert such input to NumPy arrays prior to processing, and they often output NumPy arrays. In other words, in order to efficiently use much (perhaps even most) of today’s scientific/mathematical Python-based software, just knowing how to use Python’s built-in sequence types is insufficient - one also needs to know how to use NumPy arrays."

The difference comes when we are calculating the weighted average. If that is the case then we have to use np.average(). With np.average function we can calculate both arithmetic mean and weighted average. In this article, we have shown the basic use case of both functions and how they are different from each other.\n",

        "ANS:- Vectorization and broadcasting are important concepts in NumPy that enhance the efficiency of array operations in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Vectorization Concept:-** Vectorization allows us to perform operations on entire arrays at once instead of using loops to iterate through individual elements. This is possible because NumPy's operations are implemented in optimized C code, which makes them much faster than Python loops. For example, if we want to add two arrays together, we can do it directly like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "    import numpy as np\n",

        "\n",
        "    In this example, the addition is applied to each corresponding element of a and b without needing to write a loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Broadcasting Concept:-** Broadcasting, on the other hand, allows NumPy to work with arrays of different shapes during arithmetic operations. When you perform operations on arrays of different sizes, NumPy automatically expands the smaller array across the larger one to make their shapes compatible. This means you can easily perform operations without reshaping the arrays manually.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, if we add a scalar to an array, broadcasting handles it seamlessly:-\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Create an array\n",
        "    a = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",

        "    # Output:- [6 7 8]\n",
        "\n",
        "    Here, the scalar 5 is broadcasted to match the shape of a, allowing for element-wise addition.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Another example of broadcasting is when adding a 1D array to a 2D array:-**\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Create a 2D array\n",
        "    b = np.array([[1, 2, 3],\n",
        "                 [4, 5, 6]])\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Create a 1D array\n",
        "    c = np.array([10, 20, 30])\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Add the 1D array to the 2D array\n",
        "    result = b + c\n",
        "    print(result)\n",
